# DE2-NIOSII-Blackjack
Simple Blackjack

This project is not full fledged blackjack by any means. Its more of a glorified game of "21",
meaning it has a smattering of rules found in blackjack.

The program was implemented in C and was written to be run with the DE2 Media Computer on the NIOSII processor. If run on anything else, the pointers to the memory addresses of the peripheral registers will need to be modified. But feel free to modify it as needed!
